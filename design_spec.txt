Design Specification

BJay needs a discord bot to allow administration of the outfit, events and tracking member participation
It will need to keep track of events that have been started. Events to start. And the event participants.
Through participation, outfit members will earn experierence as a metric for measuring participation

Each event will have a list of participants, a start time, a duration and the roles avaiable in that event.
Each participant will fill up a role.
After the event has ended, each participant will earn expierence provided they attended the event.
Just before an event starts, the bot will ask each participant to confirm their attendance.

Out with events, participants will be able to see their level. And outfit leaders will be able to see levels of everyone
Each participant will have a log of events they have been too, and the last time they were at the event.

Each member will have to claim a character within the outfit
